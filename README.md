Goal: Create an application to track financial data from 10-K filings back to source systems for SOX compliance at a P&C insurance company.

Core Problem: Need to map complex data flows that go through 15+ systems (source → staging → transformations → reporting) with ability to add notes at each step. Excel gets too messy for this.

Key Features Needed
Visual Mapping:

Interactive flowchart showing data path from 10-K line items to source systems

Drag-and-drop interface to build and modify data flows

Ability to zoom in/out for complex mappings

Documentation:

Add notes and comments at each system/transformation step

Track what happens to data at each hop

Export documentation for SOX audits

Data Management:

Store information about all systems in the data pipeline

Track specific data fields through their journey

Search functionality to find systems or data elements quickly

Must-Haves
Web-based for easy access

Multi-user support with permissions

Import existing Excel tracking data

Audit trail for compliance

Simple enough for finance professionals to use

Please design a straightforward application that solves this data lineage tracking problem without overcomplicating it.
